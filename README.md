## Introduction

The Star Field Simulation project aims to provide an immersive visual experience by simulating a field of stars in a three-dimensional space. It utilizes the p5.js library, which is a JavaScript library for creative coding and visualization.

The simulation generates a dynamic star field where each star moves independently, creating a sense of depth and motion. The stars are rendered using point sprites, allowing for efficient rendering of a large number of stars without significant performance impact.

## Installation

To run the Star Field Simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have [Node.js â†—](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-field-simulation.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd star-field-simulation
```

4. Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the star field simulation, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The simulation will immediately begin, and you will see stars moving in a visually mesmerizing way.

You can interact with the simulation using the following controls:

- **Mouse Movement**: Move the mouse to change the camera's viewpoint.
- **Scroll**: Zoom in and out of the star field.

Feel free to modify the code in `sketch.js` to experiment with different settings, such as the number of stars, their colors, and movement patterns. The `p5.js` library provides a rich set of functions and utilities that you can explore to customize the simulation further.
